 Get all VMs in the subscription with the Tag MigTest-StartStop-Test:99 and Shut them down if they are running
 In this section we are filtering our Get-AzureRMVM statement by selecting VM's that have a Key of MigTest-StartStop-Test and Value of 99, We also have implemented an If statement to only
 run against VMs that are already running.

                                            #This is where you would set your custom Tags Keys and Values

Where-Object {$PSItem.Tags.Keys -eq "KurveUptimeScheduleDefinition" -and $PSItem.Tags.Values -eq "HN" `
-and $PSItem.PowerState -eq "VM running"}
 
ForEach ($VM in $VMs)

    Write-Output "Shutting down: $($VM.Name)"
    Stop-AzureRMVM -Name $VM.Name -ResourceGroupName $VM.ResourceGroupName -Force

This next section is optional. Originally I used this runbook to shutdown VMs in a order so at the end of the Tier 2 Runbook
I would call the Tier 1 Runbook and finally the Tier 0 runbook. For Startup I would reverse the order to ensure services came up correctly.
By splitting the runbooks I ensured the next set of services did not start or stop until the previous set had finished.

$NextRunbook = <Fill in Next Runbook Name for this example our next Runbook would be "Blog_Shutdown_Tier1">
$AutomationAccountName = <Automation Account Name ours was "BlogAutomation">
$ResourceGroup = <Automation Account ResourceGroup ours was "AzureAutomation-Blog">

Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -Name $NextRunbook -AutomationAccountName $AutomationAccountName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroup
